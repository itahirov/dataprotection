# dataprotection

Project does not contains all the files necessarry to run it. 

But the files can be generated by **dotnet new mvc** command

DataProtection keys saving to BlobStorage example.

Access key for blob storage need to be placed to startup.cs blobstorage initialisation 
![accesskey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38325195/120484015-a7993d00-c380-11eb-993d-b472dd231ed5.jpg)

csproj file contains necessary libraries to connect to blob storage.
They might need to be installed by running **dotnet restore** 

So after running this project by **dotnet run**, you will see new xml file with data protection keys created in you blob storage. 
To test it again you may just point to the new file and run the project again. 
_var blobClient= new BlobClient(cnstr,"dataprotection","key9.xml");_

This also has Keyvault example but commented. I will need to work on it pefore publish and explain.
